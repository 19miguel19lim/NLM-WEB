            Middle-funnel content is crucial for nurturing prospects who are
            aware of their legal needs but haven't yet decided on an attorney.
            These potential clients are evaluating their options and comparing
            different law firms. At TrueNorth, we help law firms create
            compelling middle-funnel content that builds trust and moves
            prospects closer to hiring decisions.
