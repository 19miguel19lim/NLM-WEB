        </h3>
        <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Local lead generation focuses on attracting potential customers who
          are geographically close to your business and actively looking for
          your products or services. This approach offers several key
          advantages:

              from friends and neighbors.
